A lion was asleep in the sun one day. A little mouse
came out to play. The little mouse ran up the lion
neck and slid down his back. The lion caught him
with a great big smack!

I am going to eat you!, the lion roared, his mouth open wide.

No, no, please do not!, the little mouse cried. Be kind to me and one day I will
help you.

I am a lion! You are a mouse! What can you do?, The lion laughed, very hard,
and the mouse ran away.

But the mouse was out walking the very next day. He heard a big roar, and
squeaked when he saw the king of the jungle tied to a tree. But the mouse
had a plan to set him free. The mouse worked quickly and chewed through
the rope.

The lion said, Oh little mouse, I had no hope. You were right, little mouse
thank you, I am free. You are the best friend there ever could be!
